Unfortunately, users wont be able to watch glasses-free 3D on the LG Optimus Pads 8.9-inch screen. 3D video watching will be done by either using glasses on the tablets screen, or by streaming the signal via HDMI 1.4 to a compatible 3D TV or monitor (again, for use with glasses).

Meizu-m2_id9555|When compared to its extremely popular affordable phablet sibling, the 5.5-inch Meizu M2 Note, one can see that the Meizu M2 cuts some corners: the 5-inch screen features a 720 x 1280-pixel resolution (vs 1080p on the M2 Note), and the system chip is the less capable MT6735 (vs the MT6753). We would not consider those deal-breakers in any way, though: the display is still sharp with pixel density close to that of, say, the iPhone, while the system chip is on par with the Snapdragon 410 used in devices like the new Moto G (however, the Moto G costs twice as much). The Meizu M2 features the same 13MP/5MP (rear/front) camera setup as the M2 Note. See the page for all specs.

Inside ticks a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 SoC with a 1.8GHz maximum clock speed. Yup, turns out that the rumors of the phone packing an SD 810 were incorrect.

Motorola-Moto-G-2015_id9513|The Moto G (2015) still packs a 5” display with a 720 x 1280 resolution, giving it a 294 PPI density. This is crisp enough, especially for the class of device, and we are a bit relieved the Motorola didnt try to boost the resolution, which mightve ended up overburdening the GPU and battery. The SoC under the hood is a quad-core Snapdragon 410 – Qualcomms entry-level 64-bit solution, boosting the series out of the 32-bit era. Heres the interesting part now – the Moto G (2015) is the first of its line to come in two variants – one will have 8 GB of internal storage and 1 GB of RAM, while the other one will have 16 GB of storage and 2 GB of RAM – quite generous for a device of its class, but needed for future-proofing.

In terms of camera, the device packs impressive specs – its main snapper rocks a 21 MP sensor with F2.0 aperture and a dual-tone LED flash, while the frontal cam has a 5 MP sensor. Motorolas UI philosophy is along the lines of “the lighter – the better”. The midranger comes with Android 5.1.1 installed out-of-the-box and offers it in its vanilla form.

Gionee-Elife-S7_id9287|The Elife S7 is 5.55 mm (0.22quot;), which is apparently Gionees threshold when it comes to thickness now.

Lenovo-VIBE-Shot_id9266|The Lenovo Vibe Shot is amazingly stylish, highly affordable, and, from the looks of it, truly capable camera-centric Android phone. If a 16 MP BSI sensor with optical image stabilization, tricolor LED flash, and six-element lens with sapphire coating doesnt make a camera-oriented handset, we dont know what does, but the kicker is that Lenovo managed to stuff all that jazz in a premium 7.3mm thin chassis that is built of aluminum, with Gorilla Glass 3 front and rear surface. Kudos to Lenovo for pulling the style off, but thats not all -the Vibe Shot is equipped with a fine 5quot; 1080p display that offers 400+ ppi density, a 64-bit Snapdragon 615 chipset that is just a step below Qualcomms finest, 3 GB of RAM, and the generous 32 GB of storage to save all the media you are going to create with the phone, plus a microSD slot if you need more space.

Sony-Xperia-Z2-Tablet_id8419|The Xperia Tablet Z is still one of the most highly coveted Android tablets in its class. It is only natural to have high expectations about its successor. Then again, the Xperia Tablet Z was so complete that it didnt leave that much room for improvement over a year. This isnt to say it didnt have any weak spots. For example, the Xpera Tablet Z2s 10.1-inch display has been reworked for the better. It offers better color reproduction and viewing angles compared to the Xperia Tablet Z1. Colors retain their consistency and distortion has been eliminated. On top of that, the Xpera Tablet Z2 manages to shave off some weight and thickness, while growing some additional muscle with Qualcomms latest Snapdragon 801 CPU and 3GB of RAM. Everything else is largely the same. The design, the 6000mAh battery and the 2.2MP front/8MP rear cameras have all been preserved from last year.

Stereo speakers are now available, as well as noise cancellation and many more software and hardware extras. The Xperia Z2 is powered by a 3200mAh battery, which considerably improves talk time.

Sony-Xperia-M2_id8455|The Sony Xperia M2 has grown considerably, and its display now measures in at 4.8-inches.

The processor, now a respectable 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 400, has also seen an upgrade, and allows the Xperia M2 to hook up to a 4G LTE network. While on the topic of connectivity, its worth pointing out that the M2 will also come in a dual SIM version. The rest of the hardware highlights include an 8-megapixel camera, with Sonys proven Exmor RS sensor, 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage, and a fairly large, 2300mAh battery.

Samsung-Galaxy-Grand_id7583|The Galaxy Grand is mostly about having a big screen at an affordable price. The screen is not HD, it is not a high-resolution display, but instead to arrive at that price Samsung had to pick a WVGA, or 480 x 800-pixel panel. That works out to a pixel density of around 186ppi, which is far from retina and decisively mid-range, so you’d be able to see some jagged edges on icons. Under the hood, the Samsung Galaxy Grand runs on a 1.2GHz dual-core processor of unknown breed, and on the back there is a capable 8-megapixel camera. Good news is there is little shutter-lag and start-up is allegedly quick.

Unfortunately, there is 16 GB of internal storage, but no microSD slot for expansion. The unibody design supposes a non-removable battery, and it is indeed the case, with the unit carrying 2,500 mAh capacity, which is decent for the specs. Add to this the Dirac HD audio usually reserved for home cinema systems, and the Oppo turns into Gangnam Style phone, at least on paper. See the page for all specs.

Nokia-Lumia-820_id7472|Nokia Lumia 820 is situated in the mid-range class, a notch below the Nokia Lumia 920, yet promises a Windows Phone 8 experience identical to what a high-end device is expected to deliver. First thing youll notice about the Nokia Lumia 820 is its colorful outfit and the unibody look of its construction. The smartphone will be available with red, yellow, grey, cyan, purple, white and black. interchangeable shells, some of which allow the device to be charged wirelessly.

The 4.0-inch LCD screen features WVGA, or 480 x 800-pixel resolution. HTC has packed this with a Qualcomm dual-core Snapdragon S4 chip clocked at 1GHz. This however is not one of the monster 28nm chips seen in high-end devices, but rather a very modest Cortex A5 chip made using 45nm technology. Dubbed S4 Play, the chip stutters with more intensive tasks, but youd expect this of a mid-range device after all. The Desire X features a 5-megapixel camera that should be a pretty decent shooter with backside illuminated sensor, HTC’s own ImageChip and best of all some of the camera features we’ve seen on higher end models like fast activation, burst shots (but much slower, at 2 frames per second) and VideoPic that allows you to take still while you record video.

The Galaxy Note II is armed with a brighter and larger 5.5” HD Super AMOLED display with resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels. While this means that pixel density will be slightly lower compared to the original Note, in reality, the image quality shouldnt suffer any losses, as this screen used the standard RGB matrix, instead of PenTile, which means more subpixels, and ultimately – clarity. The bezel is slimmer, so despite the increase in screen size overall the device is not bigger. Powered by the same Samsung Exynos 4412 quad-core processor thats also found in the Galaxy S III, but clocked up, to the whopping 1.6GHz, the Note II will have no trouble running any application you can think of.

Internal memory is 4GB, but thankfully we have a microSD card slot to expand that with up to 32GB more.

Sony-Xperia-T_id7332|Sony Xperia T is the companys newest flagship the Android ICS-powered device.

This, however, isnt where the interesting features of this display end. Sony has also employed its WhiteMagic technology here in the Xperia T. What it does is allowing you to set the brightness of the display really high, but the extra white pixel comes at the expense of natural color representation, at least in the Xperia P. The CPU residing inside the Sony Xperia T is the trusty dual-core Snapdragon S4 with Adreno 225 graphics, so you are unlikely to feel underpowered with it. NFC is thrown into the ring here, too, for sharing media, files and mobile payments.

Not too shabby for something that is also meant to resist the elements, dont you think?

Powering the device is a quad-core Tegra 3 processor, so we can be sure that performance will be top-notch, as long as Sony doesnt mess something up as far as software goes. The camera of the Xperia Tablet S should be pretty decent, with Sonys great heritage in this area. The Tablet S comes with an 8-megapixel main unit, complemented by a 1-megapixel front-facing one. When it comes to ports you have a full-sized SD port, USB and HDMI. The tablet keeps the IR sensor from the original Tablet S and doubles as a remote control. See the page for all specs.
